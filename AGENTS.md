## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Project overview

neko-ui is a WebComponents UI component library built with SolidJS and TypeScript. It provides ~50 framework-agnostic UI components. The documentation site is generated by `@moneko/core`.

### Key commands

See `package.json` `scripts` for the full list. The most important:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pnpm start` | Dev server (docs site) on https://localhost:3000 |
| `pnpm run lint` | ESLint + Stylelint (runs `postlint` automatically) |
| `npx jest --coverage` | Run tests (do NOT use `pnpm test` — it adds `--watchAll`) |
| `pnpm run build` | Build library (es/, lib/) |
| `pnpm run build -- --config=umd` | Build UMD bundle |

### Gotchas

- **pnpm version**: CI uses pnpm v9. pnpm v10 blocks postinstall scripts for `@swc/core` and others, breaking the test toolchain. The update script pins pnpm v9 globally.
- **Jest preset**: The `@moneko/solid` jest-preset.js is ESM and relies on `@moneko/jsx-dom-expressions` + `@moneko/transform-imports` (SWC WASM plugins) that have version-compatibility issues with `@swc/core`. The current `jest.config.mjs` uses `babel-jest` with `babel-preset-solid` instead, which is more reliable.
- **Jest 30**: Uses `toHaveBeenCalled()` not `toBeCalled()` (removed in Jest 30).
- **testPathIgnorePatterns**: The patterns `/components/code/` and `/components/md/` are intentionally excluded from tests. Use specific paths, not substrings (e.g. `code` would also match `qrcode`).
- **Dev server HTTPS**: `pnpm start` launches an HTTPS dev server with a self-signed certificate. Browsers will show a certificate warning.
- **Pre-commit hooks**: The `prepare` script installs git hooks. Commits run `lint:commit` which includes ESLint, Stylelint, and changelog generation. Always lint before committing.
